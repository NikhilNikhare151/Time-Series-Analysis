# Time Series Analysis - Electricity Price & Demand Forecasting using ARIMA

# Machine Learning | Time Series Forecasting | ARIMA Model

# Overview
This project performs Time Series Forecasting to predict electricity prices and demand using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). By analyzing historical electricity consumption and pricing data, the model helps in forecasting future trends, aiding energy sector decision-making.

# Dataset Details
The dataset contains electricity price and demand records over time.

# Key attributes:
Timestamp – Date & Time of electricity usage.
Electricity Price ($/kWh) – Historical energy price.
Energy Demand (MW) – Power consumption in megawatts.
Temperature & Other Factors (Optional) – External influences on demand.

# Technologies & Tools Used
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels)
* Time Series Models (ARIMA, SARIMA)
* Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

# Results & Key Findings
* The ARIMA model accurately forecasted electricity demand and price fluctuations.
* Identified seasonal trends affecting energy consumption.
